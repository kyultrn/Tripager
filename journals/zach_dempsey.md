Set up group fork, started adding journals, API keys, and basic project set up. We finished our wire frame in the morning, started working on fast API endpoints again. Finished our tables and went over what we would work on the next day.
### Fri, Feb 10 2023
We went over how to write issues with learn and had a couple of questions about the endpoints, We were told they may be wrong, but they were correct. I was slow as fuck doing my issues with the back to back days of no sleep. A team member was not satisfied by our effort, except for Kyle's it seemed. We need to go over fast API in learn for the weekend.

We presented wireframes in the morning and decided a couple last minute changes. Went over API lecture with riley. We decided on which database we would use going forward and ended up with postgres. We started setting up our project to get to the authentication phase. Setting up the database was harder than we expected, learn showed us one way and we were told to do another. Connecting the containers was a pain in the ass and very frustrating.

### Tues, Feb 14 2023
in the morning we finished setting up our tables and ran into several errors. Helped another team figure out how to fix the CRLF problem with pc which we had the previous day. Had to fix a requirements.txt error which wasn't allowing me to build my containers. Almost completed our accounts router paths. had some general issues connecting databases.
### Weds, Feb 15 2023
we had to blow up our accounts paths and start over for authentication. We were getting a dict not related to password something, this was caused by not updating my table to allow the hashed_password. Once our authentication worked we started adding tables, queries, and routers for trips.
### Thurs, Feb 16 2023
we finished all event functions and cleaned up models. We changed variable names to better suit our expectations. We went over how we're going to prepare over the weekend.
