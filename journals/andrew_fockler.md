Another long day but we are still moving along. Kyle never fails to let down the team with his abundance of knowledge and quality problem solving skills. Troubleshooting with Candice helped our token issue and we were able to resolve a few other bugs with some of the SEIRS. I added some styling to our Trips tables and fixed the small bugs with our video displaying on the homepage. Overall a very good day from the team despite the never ending bugs!

Today we all wrote some unit tests. We made a unit test for almost every route and then ended up finding out that we only needed 4 but better to check them all anyways!
