Today, our group completed our wireframe, tables and API endpoints. We verified all of our Gitlabs were working. We created working branches for each person -- mischaworking, etc. so that each person can feel comfortable committing their work consistently without fear of messing up the main branch. We did some research on the Yelp API and what the data was going to look like coming back as JSON. We created our journals, keys.py and are looking forward to starting to work on the back end together.

Today we presented our project to the class and got good feedback. Before the presentation we added a few things to the wire frame: We added an additional page for when someone gets recommendations from the API and we also added an "About the site" page where we will show bios about the developers and have a blurb about the website, our idea, project, etc. Today we solidified the database structure, finally choosing a postgres DB and began implementing it.

Today we got migrations rolling. After a couple of issues, we were able to finally create the first migration of our accounts file. We also set up pool.py.

Today we finished authentication and got a bunch of routes working. We also created a table for trips. By the end of the day: get one trip, get list of trips were both working. Today we also created a new branch and verified that it was working. The project is going well and we are working as a team.
