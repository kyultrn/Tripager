Today, our group completed our wireframe, tables and API endpoints. We verified all of our Gitlabs were working. We created working branches for each person -- mischaworking, etc. so that each person can feel comfortable committing their work consistently without fear of messing up the main branch. We did some research on the Yelp API and what the data was going to look like coming back as JSON. We created our journals, keys.py and are looking forward to starting to work on the back end together.

Today we presented our project to the class and got good feedback. Before the presentation we added a few things to the wire frame: We added an additional page for when someone gets recommendations from the API and we also added an "About the site" page where we will show bios about the developers and have a blurb about the website, our idea, project, etc. Today we solidified the database structure, finally choosing a postgres DB and began implementing it.

Today we got migrations rolling. After a couple of issues, we were able to finally create the first migration of our accounts file. We also set up pool.py.

Today we finished authentication and got a bunch of routes working. We also created a table for trips. By the end of the day: get one trip, get list of trips were both working. Today we also created a new branch and verified that it was working. The project is going well and we are working as a team.

Today we got a lot done. We changed our API routes to be restful by adding /api/ in front of them. We also were able to complete the entire events.py queries and routes. We struggled with figuring out whether or not we would need to track events by both id AND trip_id or if just using the id would link the event to the trip. I contributed mostly to the delete function as the main programmer. We experimented with how to add start_time and end_time --- as time or strings in our tables and found it tricky to figure out using the browser fastAPI route what was the correct way to do it. Our back end is almost officially done!! All we have left to do is make the calls to the Yelp API.

We started the day off setting up our Yelp API -- query and router. We did some troubleshooting and were able to complete the calls. After lunch we set up the weather api and officially completed backend! We then went on to begin our React! We started with the login stuff. It proved more difficult than we expected. The functions, classes etc that I had previously done in other projects and been taught did not seem to directly relate to what we needed to do and it was a little frustrating. Luckily Kyle seemed to figure some of it out before we clocked out for the day and we all worked as a team to do the rest. We have a very solid plan for what we are going to do tmrw and we feel good about our progress as a whole.
