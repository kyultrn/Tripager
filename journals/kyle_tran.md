### Fri, Feb 10 2023
    Today, We did our Issues for all of our features.
### Mon, Feb 13 2023
    Today, our leader Mischa presented our wireframe to the class and was muted for the first minute. After lunch and lectures, we started working on the project and ran into a pile of issues setting up our directories/files and docker devs/yaml but through perserverance zach and I managed to figure it out.
### Tues, Feb 14 2023
    Today, we finished setting up our tables and ran into several errors. Had to fix a requirements.txt error which wasn't allowing us to build our containers. Almost completed the account router paths. Had some general issues connecting databases.
### Weds, Feb 15 2023
    Today, we completed our trip routes and authentication for accounts. Fix a small error that mr chatgpt found. Learned a bit about git from Tyler and Justin [SEIRs]. Mischa and I had a merge conflict but it was resolved very quickly :) .
### Thurs, Feb 16 2023
    Today, we finished all event functions and cleaned up models. We changed variable names to better suit our expectations. We went over how we're going to prepare over the weekend.

### Tues, Feb 21 2023
    Today, we attempted the login form and got it to display but the functionality still doesn't work.
### Weds, Feb 22 2023
    Today, we worked on the Login and Signup components. After four hours, we managed to grab the token from the front end.
### Thurs, Feb 23 2023
    Today, we used redux and created our paths for the events/trips frontend. We set up our List of User's trips component ot display all trips for the current user. Having trouble trying to display specific event for each trip.
### Fri, Feb 24 2023
    Today, we learned how to create and use a form slice. Got stuck trying to update and save updated data. Worked on a modal for sign up instead of a page.
### Mon, Feb 27 2023
    Today, we went over what we did the previous week about modals and how we control its state with a slice, pretty cool stuff.
### Tues, Feb 28 2023
    Today, we had issues working with our authentication and components. Changed all of our useState to redux so it's consistent.
### Weds, Mar 1 2023
    Today, we fully implemented redux into authentication front end. We made changes to our home page for navbar and other styling. Our logout endpoint was missing an s in invalidatesTags which sent us down a rabbit hole trying to figure out why the token still existed after logging out unless we the user refreshes.
### Thurs, Mar 2 2023
    Today, we decided to go over what's been going on in the past week and a half and how all our components interact with each other and explaining how redux works. Very important to check up on how everyone is feeling and how comfortable they are with new technologies we've been learning such as Redux, which has quite a learning curve.
    After reviewing, it seemed like my team had a stronger understanding of how redux works with tripager and redux in general, which makes me happy.
